Welcome to the repository for my implementation of **8-bit breadboard computer** project based on [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater) provided videos and schematics. This project is a culmination of my knowledge from electronics and computer architecture courses, where I've put theory into practice to build a fully functional computer from scratch.

[The Simple-As-Possible (SAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple-As-Possible_computer) computer is a minimalist design that aims to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of computer architecture in a straightforward manner. This project is my attempt to create a similar computer on a breadboard, which I believe is a practical way to understand and appreciate the complexity of computer systems.
